# Basic Bond Concepts and the Term Structure of Interest Rates

**This Jupyter Article is Chapter One of the Volume *Three:Basic Concepts of Fixed Income*.  Highlights of the Chapter are:**

* ***Financial Concepts***

    * *Basic bond pricing*
    * *Defining the term structure of interest rates*
    * *Calculating and graphing the term structure of interest rates*
    * *The term structure and the state of financial markets*

* ***Python Concepts***

    * *NumPy arrays*
    * *Python DataFrames*
    * *Accesing data with a URL address*
    * *Custom modules*

The Chapter includes the Chapter's notebook as well as the two functions imported from the custom module of the Volume.


* The Jupyter notebook for (*Basic Bond Concepts And Term Structure Of Interest Rates*)
* The code of two functions used in the notebook- (parent_folder_subfolder and one-y-axis)




Beyond simply viewing the notebook, there are several ways to interact with it:

**Downloading the Notebook:**

* *Click the download icon.*

**Copying Code Cells:**

   * *Hover over the upper-right corner of a code cell to reveal the copy option.*

**Launch Options:**

* *The launch icon provides three choices:*
    * **Binder:** Opens the notebook in a new browser tab. Binder typically launches in under a minute and supports up to 100 simultaneous users for the current version used by Financial Python.
    * **Colab:** Launches a Colab version of the notebook directly, without requiring Binder. A Google Drive is not necessary for launching, but it is for saving a copy.
    * **Live Code:** Allows users to execute any code cell directly within the notebook. This option requires a Binder launch.

# Functions Imported By the Volume *Basic Concepts Of Fixed Income*

Chapter One's notebook imports two helper functions:

1. ***parent_folder_subfolder:*** This function helps track files generated by the notebook. It is designed for users running the notebook with Jupyter Lab or as a Colab notebook and is not effective for notebooks launched with Binder, Colab, or Live Code.

2. ***one-y-axis:*** This function utilizes the matplotlib library to graph multiple series on a single y-axis.

Both functions are part of a module downloaded from DropBox. These and other functions within the module are intended to shift focus from coding to financial concepts.

        "### ***Introduction to Bond Pricing***\n",
        "#### This chapter will introduce some fundamental principles of fixed income. These principles include pricing coupon bonds as a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds, the term structure of interest rates, and the relation between spot and forward rates of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ***The Present Value of a Bond***\n",
        "#### Chapter Two of *Basic Financial and Python Concepts* asserted that the value of an asset with certain cash flows equals the present value of its cash flows, as shown in the following equation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\Large Value = \\sum_{t=1}^{T}Cash\\,Flow_t\\times PV(t)$$\n",
        "#### where $\\ T$ is the total number of cash flow periods, and $\\ PV(t)$ is the present-value factor for a certain cash flow in period $t$.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### In finance, equating value with present value is ubiquitous and seems unworthy of much thought. It is, however, a powerful statement that value depends upon the ability to replicate an asset with other assets. Namely, if an asset's cash flow dates and amounts can be replicated by another asset or combinations of assets, the values must be equal. You might call this idea the ***law of one price***&mdash;a concept that is key in all pricing models.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ***Coupon Bonds and Zero-Coupon Bonds***\n",
        "#### Most bonds, but not all, pay fixed coupons in each period and principal at their maturity. The values of coupon bonds are calculated as:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\large Coupon\\, Bond= \\sum_{t=1}^{T}Coupon_t\\times PV(t)+ Principal_T\\times PV(T)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Some bonds only repay principal at maturity, or $T$. Because there are no periodic coupon payments, these bonds are appropriately known as zero-coupon bonds. The values of zero-coupon bonds are calculated as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\large Zero\\,Coupon\\, Bond =Principal_T\\times PV(T)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "#### In order to price any bond, it's necessary to know the present value of payments at the relevant dates. If the zero-coupon bond values are known for the relevant dates, the present value of each date can be determined. To do so, divide the value of the zero-coupon bond by its principal, as shown below:\n",
        "\n",
        " $$\\large  PV(t)=\\frac{Zero\\,Coupon\\, Bond_t }{Principal_t}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Each coupon-bond cash flow is equivalent to an investment in a zero-coupon bond. As such, we can replicate a coupon bond with a sequence of zero-coupon bonds: The number of zero-coupon bonds with a maturity of $t$ equals the coupon bond's cash flow at $t$ divided by the zero-coupon bond's principal. For example, consider a $\\$40$ coupon that is paid every six months before maturity. This coupon is valued with a sequence of 0.04 zero-coupon bonds, with a $\\$1,000$ principal and maturities matching the coupon payment dates. The coupon bond's payment at maturity equals 1.040 zero-coupon bonds, with a $\\$1,000$ principal and the same maturity as the coupon bond.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Further, a coupon bond's value is the sum of all the zero-coupon bond values needed to replicate that bond's cash flows. If the coupon bond and the zero-coupon bonds have the same principal, and all the coupon payments of the coupon bond are equal, the value of the coupon bond is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\large Value = \\sum_{t=1}^{T}Zero\\,Coupon\\,Bond_t\\times\\frac{Coupon}{Principal}+Zero\\,Coupon\\,Bond_T$$\n",
        "\n",
        "#### We define the sum  as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\large S(T) =\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\frac{Zero\\,Coupon\\,Bond_t}{Principal} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T}PV(t)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "#### And the value of the fixed-coupon bond is composed of two components equaling:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\large Value = S(T)\\times Coupon+PV(T)\\times Principal(T)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### ***Arbitrage and the Value of the Bond***\n",
        "#### Thus far, bond values have been represented as the sum of the zero-coupon bonds' values. But we must consider the zero-coupon bonds' *market prices*&mdash;not their \"theoretical\" values. Will the value relation between zero-coupon and coupon bonds hold if we use the market prices of zero-coupon bonds? To answer that question, let's look at examples where the coupon bond is worth more or less than the sum of the zero-coupon bonds. First, consider a case where the coupon bond's price exceeds the sum of the zero-coupon bond prices:\n",
        "\n",
        " $$\\large Value > S(T)\\times Coupon+PV(T)\\times Principal(T)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "#### If the price of the coupon bond exceeds the sum of the zero-coupon bond prices, the coupon bond can be *shorted*.$^{1}$ The zero-coupon bonds can then be purchased with the proceeds, leaving the investor with identical cash flows for a lower price. Consider if the inequality is reversed:\n",
        "\n",
        " $$\\large Value <  S(T)\\times Coupon+PV(T)\\times Principal(T)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "#### In this case, the *zero-coupon bonds* can be shorted, and the proceeds can be used to buy the coupon bond. This ability to recreate cash flows allows for arbitrage between zero-coupon and coupon bonds; as a result, the coupon bond prices equal the costs of the zero-coupon bonds used to recreate their cash flows. It is the law of one price in action. Whatever the bond prices might have been in theory does not matter. Those prices were ideas&mdash;the market value is a fact.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### This arbitrage relationship is important for deriving the *term of structure of interest rates* and *forward rates*, which we'll examine later in this chapter. These concepts are key to understanding bond pricing as well as some important fixed-income derivatives.\n",

        "#### The NumPy library offers efficient numerical procedures that simplify complex calculations.$^{3}$ The fundamental object in this library is the NumPy array. An array is simply a data structure in which elements are arranged and accessed. It can be formed from a single value or from an iterable data type like a list, which holds a series of values.$^{4}$ NumPy must be imported before use; recall that in this Notebook, it was imported and aliased as <font color='green'>np</font> in the first code cell. The <font color='green'>array()</font> method is used to convert variables into NumPy arrays.$^{5}$ The following code creates an array from the list <font color='green'>[3%, 5%, 7%]</font> (lists are stylized with square brackets) and assigns that array to <font color='green'>interest_rates</font>. This is then passed to <font color='green'>display()</font>, which simply displays the contents of <font color='green'>interest_rates</font>.\n",

        "#### Using Pandas and NumPy, the term structure of interest rates was calculated for September 15$^{th}$ 2022, and September 30$^{th}$ 2025. These term structures reveal an economy in transition. On September 15$^{th}$ 2022, rates were increasing with maturity and expected to continue rising. By September 30$^{th}$ 2025 the pattern had shifted. Although the overall level of rates was higher on September 30$^{th}$ 2025, the term structure showed a slight downward slope. These differences indicate two different economic states: inflation was expected to increase in September 2022 but not  in September 2025. The ability to calibrate the term structure of interest rates in this way highlights the utility of Python and its rich ecosystem of libraries."
